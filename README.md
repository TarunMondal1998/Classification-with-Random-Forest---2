# Classification-with-Random-Forest---2
## Machine Learning: Random Forest Classifier
Use Random Forest to prepare a model on fraud data 
Treating those who have taxable_income <= 30000 as "Risky" and others are "Good".

### Objective:
The aim of this project is to develop a Random Forest Classification model to identify individuals with ‘Risky’ taxable income.

### Methodology:
The methodology is based on machine learning algorithms based on secondary quantitative fraud data. The target variable (Taxable.Income) has been categorised into two categories (Risky and Good), where taxable_income <= 30000 has been considered as “Risky” and others are “Good”. Thus, due to the categorical nature of the target variable, the Classification algorithm has been preferred in this project. Random Forest Classification model has been opted for this study, which has been developed, trained and evaluated using Python programming language in Jupyter Notebook IDE.
